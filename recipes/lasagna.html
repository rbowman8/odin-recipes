    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <li>1 teaspoon olive oil</li>
    <li>1 medium yellow onion, <em>diced</em></li>
    <li>5 cloves garlic, <em>minced</em></li>
    <li>kosher salt</li>
    <li>1/2 pound hot italian sausage</li>
    <li>1/2 pound ground beef</li>
   <li>28 ounces marinara sauce</li>
   <li>15 ounces ricotta cheese</li> 
   <li>1 large egg</li>
   <li>2 tablespoons parmesan cheese, <em>freshly grated</em></li>
   <li>1 tablespoon parsley</li>
   <li>8 no-boil, oven ready lasagna noodles</li>
   <li>2 cups mozzarella cheese, <em>freshly grated</em></li>
</ul>

<ol>
    <h4>Instructions</h4>
    <li>Preheat your oven to 375℉ (or 190℃) and grease a 9x9x2.5-inch square baking dish.</li>
    <li>Add olive oil, onion and garlic with a pinch of kosher salt to a deep sided skillet. Heat on medium-low, stir and cook 5 minutes or until softened.</li>
    <li>Increase the heat to medium-high and add in the ground meat or sausage. Use a wooden spatula or spoon to break up the sausage. Stir often until no longer pink and the meat is browned. Drain and discard any fat in the pan.</li>
    <li>Once the sausage or meat is browned and the fat removed from the pan, pour in the marinara. I added 1 (28-ounce) jar to a liquid measuring cup and added enough water until it reached 4 cups.
Remove the pan from the heat and pour the marinara. There's no need to simmer.</li>
    <li>Meanwhile, in a medium bowl combine the ricotta, egg, 2 tablespoon parmesan cheese and parsley. Season with a pinch of kosher salt and some freshly ground black pepper. Stir to combine.</li>
    <li>Spread a few large spoonfuls of sauce on the bottom of the prepared baking dish.</li>
</ol>

<ol>
    <h4>Layer One</h4>
    <li>Lay down 2 noodles, side by side and top with 1/3 (I just eyeball it) of the ricotta mixture and spread it evenly.</li>
    <li>Top with 1/4 of the sauce and sprinkle with a little less than 1/3 of the 2 cups of mozzarella (or about a generous 1/2 cup).</li>
</ol>

<ol>
    <h4>Layer Two</h4>
    <li>Lay down 2 noodles (going the opposite direction), side by side and top with 1/3 of the ricotta mixture and spread it evenly.</li>
    <li>Top with 1/4 of the sauce and sprinkle with a little less than 1/3 of the mozzarella.</li>
</ol>

<ol>
    <h4>Layer Three</h4>
    <li>Lay down 2 more noodles (going the opposite direction) side by side and top with the remaining 1/3 of ricotta mixture and spread it evenly.
</li>
    <li>Top with 1/4 of the sauce. <em>(no cheese)</em></li>
</ol>
<ol>
    <h4>Layer Four</h4>
    <li>Lay down the final 2 noodles (going the opposite direction) side by side and top with the last of the sauce.</li>
    <li>Sprinkle with the remaining mozzarella cheese and parmesan.</li>
    <li>Transfer to a rimmed metal baking sheet (to catch any spill over) and bake uncovered for 30 to 40 minutes or until bubbly and the cheese is golden brown.</li>
    <li>Let cool 10 minutes before slicing and serving.</li>
</ol>
